## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
The app was created with the purpose of helping people to manage their time.
